🔐 Image Encryption and Decryption Task This project focuses on the encryption and decryption of digital images using cryptographic techniques. The main goal is to ensure the confidentiality and security of image data during storage or transmission.
📌 Features:
Image Encryption: Converts a normal image into an encrypted version using a custom or standard cryptographic algorithm (e.g., AES, chaotic maps, etc.), making it unreadable without the correct decryption key.

Image Decryption: Restores the encrypted image back to its original form using the correct decryption key.

Support for Grayscale and RGB Images

Optional: Add noise resistance, key sensitivity analysis, or histogram equalization.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python (or your preferred language)

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, PyCrypto/Cryptography (depending on the algorithm)

🧪 Applications:
Secure transmission of sensitive images (medical, military, personal)

Digital rights protection

Preventing unauthorized access or tampering

📂 How It Works:
Input: Original image file

Encryption: Apply algorithm to scramble pixel data

Decryption: Reverse the scrambling using the same key or logic

Output: Original image is recovered if the key is correct
